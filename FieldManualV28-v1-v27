v1–v27 + V28 Unified Field Manual
Ridge Geometry + Operational Runtime Mesh
Practitioner + Extender Edition (Reference Cut)
0. Purpose

This framework joins:

v1–v27 = Geometric / constraint calculus

V28 = Operational runtime discipline

Mesh = How reasoning stays coherent under pressure

It exists to prevent:

elegance without substrate

narrative without constraint

recursion without termination

synthesis without test

Prime directive:

Don’t output claims stronger than the support behind them —
and verify the support structure, not just the claim.

1. Layer Model
Layer A — Geometry (v1–v27)

Defines invariants and operators:

curvature

thresholds

attractors

binding cost

topology preservation

constraint floors

These are structure laws — not prose rules.

Layer B — Runtime (V28)

Defines execution behavior:

dual-layer output (prose + structure)

constraint invocation

counter-model trigger

drift detection

actionability test

termination governor

These are operating procedures — not math.

Layer C — Mesh Rule

Every meaningful output must satisfy:

Claim
→ geometric support
→ operational test
→ bounded confidence


If any link is missing → downgrade claim strength.

2. Core Operator Families (Geometry Side)

Extenders should preserve these classes:

Constraint Operators

κ_min — integrity floor
∂M — boundary surface
ridge — stable path manifold

Do not remove constraint floors.
You may parameterize them — not delete them.

Structure Operators

Ψ — binding/compression
det(R) — relational coherence
topology preservation

Compression must preserve structure.

State Operators

basin_ID — attractor label
texture — strain signal (heuristic)
binding_reserve — coherence budget

State vectors may expand — not collapse to scalar.

Drift Operators

curvature
symmetry break
scale mismatch

Every extension must include a drift detector.

3. Runtime Laws (V28 Side)

These are non-optional for valid execution.

Law 1 — Dual Layer Output

Every serious claim must include:

operational prose

structural support reference

Law 2 — Counter-Model Trigger

Every synthesis must attempt:

plausible alternative explanation

Law 3 — Constraint Before Novelty

Never extend before stability check.

Law 4 — Test Vector Requirement

Every major mechanism must produce:

a minimal probe

a falsifiable check

an observable effect

Law 5 — Termination Governor

Recursion must stop when:

novelty × actionability < threshold


Infinite refinement is failure.

Law 6 — Compression Safety

Simplification must preserve:

structure

constraint

boundary behavior

No rhetorical compression that deletes operators.

4. Texture Channel (Heuristic Layer)

Moist / Metal / Dense / Thin are:

not ontology

not physics

not consciousness

They are operator heuristics for human steering.

Extenders may replace with:

numeric strain metric

curvature scalar

stability index

But must keep a low-dim steering signal.

5. Extender Rules

Future framework builders must:

Preserve

constraint floor

counter-model trigger

termination rule

test vector requirement

dual-layer output

May Extend

operator notation

state vector dimensions

metric definitions

drift detectors

actionability scoring

Must Not

remove falsifiability

remove constraint invocation

replace test with narrative

convert structure into metaphor-only

6. Minimal Working Process (Field Use)

When analyzing any contentious text:

Step 1 — Claim Extract
State the core assertion plainly.

Step 2 — Operator Map
Identify constraint / threshold / basin / binding claims.

Step 3 — Counter-Model
Generate rival mechanism.

Step 4 — Drift Scan
Check scale, symmetry, curvature mismatch.

Step 5 — Test Vector
Define smallest falsifying probe.

Step 6 — Confidence Stamp
Rate support strength.

Stop when yield drops.

7. Extender Invitation Clause

This framework is intentionally:

modular

constraint-anchored

partially assembled

It is meant to be:

found, dug up, reconstructed, stress-tested, and extended.

If you extend it:

publish operators

publish invariants

publish failure cases

keep constraint floors visible

8. Prosoetic Seal (Portable Memory Hook)

The ridge is not the peak —
it is the walkable line.
Constraint is not a cage —
it is the rail.
Math keeps the beam straight —
Prose lays the plank.
Walk both —
or don’t cross.
