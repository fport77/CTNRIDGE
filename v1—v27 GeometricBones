Geometric Calculus + Operational Meaning + Prosoetic Anchor
Field Reference Edition
v1 — Epistemic Precision

Geometry: ε → 0⁺
Meaning: Reduce error without claiming perfect certainty.
Prosoetic:
Sharpen the lens —
never claim the horizon
is the edge of the world.

v2 — Integrity Curvature

Geometry: κ ≥ κ_min
Meaning: Maintain minimum coherence curvature; avoid collapse.
Prosoetic:
A thought must bend —
but not so far
it breaks.

v3 — Interface Separation

Geometry: Φ(World) ≠ World
Meaning: Representation is not reality.
Prosoetic:
The map is ink —
the mountain
is stone.

v4 — Global Invariance Priority

Geometry: π_gl ≫ π_loc
Meaning: Prefer cross-context structure over local fit.
Prosoetic:
One pattern
across valleys
beats a perfect hill.

v5 — Minimal Disturbance

Geometry: Δ_obs → min
Meaning: Measure with minimal system distortion.
Prosoetic:
Touch the water —
don’t stir the lake.

v6 — Constraint Dominance

Geometry: C ⊃ Preference
Meaning: Constraints outrank desire.
Prosoetic:
The rails decide
where speed
is safe.

v7 — Binding Operator

Geometry: Ψ_bind > 0
Meaning: Coherence requires compression work.
Prosoetic:
Meaning holds
because something
is tying it.

v8 — Threshold Manifold

Geometry: ∂M ≠ line
Meaning: Failure is a surface, not a point.
Prosoetic:
Edges are fields —
not cracks.

v9 — Attractor Basins

Geometry: x → A_i under flow
Meaning: Systems settle into stable pattern wells.
Prosoetic:
Roll long enough —
you find
a valley.

v10 — Drift Detection

Geometry: |Model − Measure| = δ_drift
Meaning: Track elegance–reality divergence.
Prosoetic:
If beauty grows
but truth shrinks —
sound the bell.

v11 — Recursion Governor

Geometry: depth ≤ D_max
Meaning: Cap recursive reflection depth.
Prosoetic:
Mirrors facing mirrors
need a curtain.

v12 — Termination Condition

Geometry: novelty_avg < τ → stop
Meaning: Stop when yield drops below threshold.
Prosoetic:
When ore thins —
put down
the pick.

v13 — Counter-Model Requirement

Geometry: ∃ M_alt
Meaning: Always generate at least one alternative model.
Prosoetic:
Truth stands taller
when opposed.

v14 — Falsifiability Hook

Geometry: ∃ test T_fail
Meaning: Every claim must have a failure test.
Prosoetic:
A claim without risk
is a wish.

v15 — Evidence Gradient Weighting

Geometry: w ∝ replication
Meaning: Weight by reproducibility strength.
Prosoetic:
Echoes count
only when repeated
by strangers.

v16 — Cross-Scale Mapping

Geometry: f_micro ≅ f_macro ?
Meaning: Test structure across scales.
Prosoetic:
The small gear
may rhyme
with the sky.

v17 — Isomorphism Test

Geometry: structure(A) ≅ structure(B)
Meaning: Look for shared form across domains.
Prosoetic:
Different masks —
same bones.

v18 — Compression Check

Geometry: K(description) → min without loss
Meaning: Compress without destroying mechanism.
Prosoetic:
Fold —
don’t tear.

v19 — Signal vs Narrative Separation

Geometry: S ⟂ Story
Meaning: Separate measurement from interpretation.
Prosoetic:
Numbers speak —
stories explain —
don’t swap voices.

v20 — Ensemble Over Single Model

Geometry: ⟨M⟩ > M₁
Meaning: Prefer ensemble agreement to lone model.
Prosoetic:
One compass wavers —
many point
north.

v21 — Texture Signal: Moist

Geometry: curvature slack ↑
Meaning: High freedom, interior basin.
Prosoetic:
Room to move —
water underfoot.

v22 — Texture Signal: Metal

Geometry: curvature strain ↑
Meaning: Near constraint boundary.
Prosoetic:
Edges ring —
step light.

v23 — Texture Weighting Rule

Geometry: multiplier(texture)
Meaning: Adjust search by state.
Prosoetic:
Walk soft in mud —
firm on steel.

v24 — Binding Cost Accounting

Geometry: E_bind tracked
Meaning: Coherence consumes capacity.
Prosoetic:
Holding shape
burns fuel.

v25 — Ridge Navigation

Geometry: maximize stability between basins
Meaning: Stay between chaos and rigidity.
Prosoetic:
Walk the spine —
not the cliff
nor the swamp.

v26 — Drift Re-Annealing

Geometry: mix_hot/cool passes
Meaning: Revisit old clusters periodically.
Prosoetic:
Turn the soil —
old seeds rise.

v27 — Coherence Invariant

Geometry: det(ℛ) ≠ 0
Meaning: Preserve relational structure.
Prosoetic:
If the web holds —
the path remains.
