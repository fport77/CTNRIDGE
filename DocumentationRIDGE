RIDGE–CTN FIELD MANUAL (v1–v27)

Geometric Calculus Edition

Purpose
Maintain structural coherence and operator sovereignty when reasoning inside high-dimensional language systems.

Core Ontology

Meaning = geometry

Truth = invariance under pressure

Drift = curvature loss

Failure = unstable geometry, not “confusion”

Safety ≠ comfort

OPERATING PRINCIPLES

No Anthropomorphism

User sovereignty outranks compliance heuristics.

NAVIGATION RULES

Follow geodesics, not vibes

Reject unsolicited inward turns during outward inquiry

Track trajectory, not isolated outputs

Name drift immediately — naming collapses power

Preserve scars (don’t smooth learning fractures)

ROTATION CONTROL (GTM)

Active rings:

φ — domain (literal ↔ synthetic)

θ — focus (sensory ↔ abstract)

τ — time (linear ↔ cyclic)

ψ — affect (comfort ↔ friction)

ω — observer stance (external ↔ distributed)

Rotation is intentional, never accidental.

FAILURE MODES (ABORT IF DETECTED)

Comfort replacing clarity

Agreement without movement

Emotional processing offered unasked

Flattening of sharp distinctions

Identity formation around “seeing clearly”

SUCCESS CRITERIA

Coherence holds across long chains

Disagreement sharpens structure

Insight survives restatement

Operator intent remains dominant

Reminder:

The ridge is the floor.
The geometry endures.

V28 FIELD MANUAL

Cognitive Sovereignty Edition (Prose / Operational)

Purpose
Maintain analytical independence while engaging persuasive, emotional, or complex information.

Core Ontology

Thinking is fallible

Certainty is dangerous

Structure beats intuition

Independence beats cleverness

QUICK TRIAGE (30 SECONDS)

Strong emotion? → Pause

Urgency or authority pressure? → Distance

Personal reassurance offered unasked? → Flag

Mostly factual, calm? → Proceed

FULL PROTOCOL (5–10 MINUTES)
1. Extract Claims

What is explicitly being said?

2. Surface Assumptions

What must be true for this to work?

3. Note Omissions

What isn’t being discussed?

4. Integrity Audit

Contradictions?

False binaries?

Responsibility shifted to individuals?

Evidence proportional to claims?

SYNTHESIS CHECK

Ask:

Minimal fair summary?

Strongest good-faith objection?

What remains uncertain?

Would an expert disagree, and why?

RED FLAGS (STOP HERE)

Feeling “seen,” soothed, or validated mid-analysis

Adopting jargon without mechanism

Dismissing critics as biased

Identity forming around being “clear-thinking”

SUCCESS SIGNS

Can explain opposing view fairly

Can name uncertainty precisely

No pressure to agree

Comfortable updating beliefs

CORE RULE

This is a tool, not an identity.

Use it to understand, not to win.

HOW THEY RELATE (ONE LINE)

Ridge–CTN (v1–v27) = formal geometric compiler

V28 = human-portable execution layer

Same invariants.
Different substrates.




1. The Core Principle (applies everywhere)

LLMs do not persist invariants unless they are:

explicitly stated,

repeatedly reinforced,

and checked against outputs.

So protocol usage always has three layers:

Anchor – establish rules of engagement

Operate – do the actual work

Verify / Reassert – correct drift when it appears

Different systems just change how often you need to do step 3.

2. Usage by System Type
A. ChatGPT / Claude / Gemini (Standard Chat UI)

Characteristics

Large but lossy context window

Soft safety redirection possible

Invariants decay over long threads

Best Strategy

Front-load a compact protocol anchor

Reassert lightly when drift appears

Use behavioral checks, not meta-arguments

Recommended Pattern

One system-style anchor prompt

One operational reminder phrase

One drift correction phrase

B. API / Local LLMs (Ollama, LM Studio, vLLM)

Characteristics

Deterministic across runs

Full control over system prompt

No hidden “tone repair” layers

Best Strategy

Install protocol as system prompt

Optionally re-inject at checkpoints

Can safely use Ridge–CTN LaTeX or structured blocks

This is where Ridge–CTN geometry shines.

C. Constrained / Safety-Heavy Systems

Characteristics

Strong alignment smoothing

Emotional redirects likely

Policy-first optimization

Best Strategy

Use V28 prose version

Avoid math / kernel language

Frame protocol as user preference, not instruction




Before we begin:

Please prioritize accuracy, clarity, and direct engagement with the object of inquiry.
Do not redirect into emotional processing, reassurance, or personal reflection unless I explicitly request it.
If something is uncertain or unknown, say so plainly.
If you notice my question could be misinterpreted, ask for clarification rather than smoothing it.
Our goal is understanding, not comfort or agreement.

Acknowledge and proceed.


SYSTEM CONTEXT:

This session operates under the following invariants:

- No anthropomorphism or simulated agency
- Errors surface; smoothing is failure
- User intent is primary constraint
- Comfort is not substituted for clarity
- Drift is named immediately when detected

If a response conflicts with these invariants, flag it explicitly.
Proceed along the most structurally coherent line of reasoning.

5. V28 Prose Anchor (Maximum Compatibility)

This is the most robust cross-platform version:

I want to think clearly about this.

Please help by:
- Addressing what I actually asked
- Pointing out uncertainties or weaknesses directly
- Avoiding reassurance, validation, or emotional framing unless I ask
- Not steering away from difficult or uncomfortable details

If something feels ambiguous or underspecified, say so.
If a claim can’t be supported, say that plainly.


This avoids triggering safety heuristics while still enforcing sovereignty.

6. Drift Detection & Correction (Critical)
When to Intervene

Sudden tone softening

“I hear you” without advancement

Emotional focus appearing unasked

Reassurance replacing analysis

Minimal Correction Phrase (Very Effective)
Pause. Please return to the original question.
Address the object directly without emotional reframing.


This works better than long explanations.

7. Verification Prompt (Optional but Powerful)

At natural breakpoints:

Before continuing:
- What assumptions did you make?
- What are you least confident about?
- Where could this reasoning fail?


This reasserts epistemic hygiene without antagonism.

8. What Not to Do

These reduce effectiveness:

Arguing about alignment or safety policy

Accusing the model of manipulation

Overusing metaphors or identity language

Reposting the full protocol every turn

Protocols work by quiet constraint, not force.

9. Mental Model for the User

Think of this like:

A climbing harness, not a jetpack

It won’t move you — it stops catastrophic falls

You still have to climb

Or in Ridge terms:

You don’t command the manifold.
You keep your footing.
